    excerpt: 'Everything you need to know about search engine optimization — from keywords to technical SEO and beyond.',
    content: `<h2>What is SEO?</h2>
<p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of optimizing your website to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). It involves technical, on-page, and off-page strategies.</p>

<h2>Keyword Research</h2>
<p>Start by identifying the keywords your target audience is searching for. Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or SEMrush to find high-volume, low-competition keywords.</p>

<h2>On-Page SEO</h2>
<p>Optimize your title tags, meta descriptions, headers, and content. Ensure each page targets a primary keyword and includes related terms naturally.</p>

<h2>Technical SEO</h2>
<p>Ensure your site is crawlable, has a proper sitemap, uses HTTPS, loads quickly, and has clean URL structures. Core Web Vitals are now a ranking factor.</p>

<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
<p>Create comprehensive, valuable content that answers user questions. Long-form content typically ranks better, but quality always trumps quantity.</p>

<h2>Link Building</h2>
<p>Earn high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites. Guest posting, creating link-worthy resources, and digital PR are effective strategies.</p>

<h2>Measuring Success</h2>
<p>Track your organic traffic, keyword rankings, click-through rates, and conversions. Use Google Analytics and Search Console for insights.</p>`,

    content: `<h2>Why Subscriptions?</h2>
<p>Subscription models provide predictable recurring revenue, higher customer lifetime value, and better cash flow predictability. Companies like Netflix, Spotify, and SaaS businesses have proven the model's effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Choosing Your Pricing Strategy</h2>
<p>Consider tiered pricing with free, basic, and premium plans. Each tier should offer clear value differentiation to encourage upgrades.</p>

<h2>Reducing Churn</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge for subscription businesses is retention. Focus on onboarding, regular engagement, and continually delivering value to reduce churn.</p>

<h2>Payment Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Use reliable payment processors like Stripe that handle recurring billing, failed payment recovery, and subscription management.</p>

<h2>Metrics to Track</h2>
<p>Monitor MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), churn rate, ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), and LTV (Lifetime Value) to understand your business health.</p>`,

    excerpt: 'A comprehensive introduction to React.js for developers who are just starting their journey.',
    content: `<h2>What is React?</h2>
<p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, created by Facebook. It uses a component-based architecture and a virtual DOM for efficient rendering.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
<p>The easiest way to start is with Create React App:</p>
<pre><code>npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start</code></pre>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Components are the building blocks of React applications. They can be functional or class-based, though modern React favors functional components with hooks.</p>

<h2>State and Props</h2>
<p>Props are read-only data passed from parent to child components. State is mutable data managed within a component using the useState hook.</p>

<h2>Hooks</h2>
<p>Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext let you use state and other React features in functional components.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore React Router for navigation, Redux or Context API for state management, and learn about performance optimization.</p>`,

<p>Remote work is here to stay. Having the right tools makes the difference between a productive team and a struggling one.</p>

<h2>1. Communication — Slack</h2>
<p>Real-time messaging with channels, threads, and integrations keeps your team connected without the chaos of email chains.</p>

<h2>2. Video Conferencing — Zoom</h2>
<p>Face-to-face meetings are still important. Zoom provides reliable video calls, screen sharing, and recording features.</p>

<h2>3. Project Management — Notion</h2>
<p>Notion combines notes, docs, wikis, and project tracking in one flexible workspace. It's perfect for documentation and planning.</p>

<h2>4. Design Collaboration — Figma</h2>
<p>Figma enables real-time design collaboration in the browser. No more emailing design files back and forth.</p>

    content: `<h2>Why Analytics Matter</h2>
<p>In the age of big data, businesses that leverage analytics outperform those that don't. Data-driven companies are 23 times more likely to acquire customers.</p>

<h2>Key Metrics to Track</h2>
<p>Focus on metrics that directly impact your business goals: conversion rates, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, and churn rate.</p>

<h2>Building Dashboards</h2>
<p>A good dashboard tells a story at a glance. Use charts, graphs, and KPIs that are relevant to your audience — whether it's executives or marketers.</p>

<h2>A/B Testing</h2>
<p>Don't guess — test. A/B testing lets you compare two versions of a page, email, or feature to see which performs better.</p>

<h2>Common Pitfalls</h2>
<p>Avoid vanity metrics, confirmation bias, and analysis paralysis. Focus on actionable insights that lead to concrete improvements.</p>`,

<p>Despite the rise of social media, email marketing remains the most effective digital marketing channel with an average ROI of $42 for every dollar spent.</p>

<h2>Building Your List</h2>
<p>Offer valuable lead magnets — ebooks, templates, free trials — in exchange for email sign-ups. Quality beats quantity.</p>

<h2>Writing Compelling Subject Lines</h2>
<p>Your subject line determines whether your email gets opened. Keep it short, create curiosity, and avoid spam trigger words.</p>

<h2>Personalization</h2>
<p>Go beyond "Hi {name}". Segment your list based on behavior, preferences, and purchase history to deliver relevant content.</p>

<h2>Automation</h2>
<p>Set up welcome sequences, abandoned cart emails, and re-engagement campaigns. Automation ensures the right message reaches the right person at the right time.</p>

<h2>Testing and Optimization</h2>
<p>Test subject lines, send times, content formats, and CTAs. Small improvements compound into significant results over time.</p>`,
